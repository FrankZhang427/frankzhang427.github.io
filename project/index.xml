      <title>Improving SIMBICON for Biped Animation</title>

      <description>Abstract Biped balance control strategy is difficult to design as biped locomotion suffers from high-dimensional action spaces, underactuated dynamics, and unstable joint controls. We propose a generalized balance control strategy that can synthesize robust biped walking locomotion. The generalization consists of two parts, a coordinated joint control and generalized ground height feedback. We also conduct principle component analysis on generated locomotion to further improve the state used in finite state machine.</description>

      <description>Abstract Reinforcement learning techniques have raised attention from financial industry, especially by employing reinforcement learning in portfolio managements. In this project, we explored three state-of-art reinforcement learning algorithms, including policy gradient (PG), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). The goal is to train an intelligent agent that can continuously trade in stock market by allocating on different assets. In the course of this project, we performed hyper-parameter tuning and feature selection for each algorithm.</description>

      <title>Mini Games in Unity</title>

      <description>Introduction I have implemented four interesting mini games for my modern computer game course. All four games were developed in Unity and require a version of 2018.2.8 at least to run properly.
Maze Shooter This is a first-person shooter game in 3D. Players can move with WASD control, jump with space, and fire projectiles with F key. The view camera is controlled by mouse input. The terrain consists of 3 parts: a starting area, a destination area, and a dynamically generated maze connecting the two areas.</description>

      <title>Simulate Link State Routing Protocol</title>

      <description>Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a pure user-space program which simulates the major functionalities of a routing device running a simplified Link State Routing protocol. To simulate the real-world network environment, you have to start multiple instances of the program, each of which connecting with (some of) others via socket. Each program instance represents a router or host in the simulated network space. Correspondingly, the links connecting the routers/hosts and the IP addresses identifying the routers/hosts are simulate by the in-memory data structures.</description>
