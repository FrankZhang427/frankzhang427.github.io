      <description>Abstract Biped balance control strategy is difficult to design as biped locomotion suffers from high-dimensional action spaces, underactuated dynamics, and unstable joint controls. We propose a generalized balance control strategy that can synthesize robust biped walking locomotion. The generalization consists of two parts, a coordinated joint control and generalized ground height feedback. We also conduct principle component analysis on generated locomotion to further improve the state used in finite state machine.</description>
