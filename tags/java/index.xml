      <description>Abstract Biped balance control strategy is difficult to design as biped locomotion suffers from high-dimensional action spaces, underactuated dynamics, and unstable joint controls. We propose a generalized balance control strategy that can synthesize robust biped walking locomotion. The generalization consists of two parts, a coordinated joint control and generalized ground height feedback. We also conduct principle component analysis on generated locomotion to further improve the state used in finite state machine.</description>

      <title>Simulate Link State Routing Protocol</title>

      <description>Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a pure user-space program which simulates the major functionalities of a routing device running a simplified Link State Routing protocol. To simulate the real-world network environment, you have to start multiple instances of the program, each of which connecting with (some of) others via socket. Each program instance represents a router or host in the simulated network space. Correspondingly, the links connecting the routers/hosts and the IP addresses identifying the routers/hosts are simulate by the in-memory data structures.</description>
